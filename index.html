<h2>Our First Groundbreaking Invention: <a href="https://seawatergreenhouse.com/" target="_blank">SeaWater greenhouse</a></h2>
<img src="02.png" class="img-responsive">
<br>
<p>The technique involves pumping seawater (or allowing it to gravitate if below sea level) to an arid location and then subjecting it to two processes: first, it is used to humidify and cool the air, and second, it is evaporated by solar heating and distilled to produce fresh water. Evaporative cooling is driven either by the wind or assisted by fans. This process is an efficient and sustainable way to reduce the temperature of an arid climate, as the water molecules absorb heat from the environment in the process of evaporation. The freshwater produced can also be used for irrigation, eliminating the need to rely on other water sources. The choice depends on the location and its wind regime. Finally, the remaining humidified air is expelled from the greenhouse and used to improve growing conditions for outdoor plants. The more concentrated salt water may either be further evaporated for the production of salt and other elements or discharged back into the sea. The seawater greenhouse is a response to the global water crisis.</p>

<h2>Our second Earth-shattering Invention: <a target="_blank" href="https://webb.nasa.gov/content/webbLaunch/deploymentExplorer.html">JWST(James Web Space Telescope)</a></h2>
<img src="03.jpg" class="img-responsive">
<br>
<p>The James Webb Space Telescope is the world's premier space science observatory. Webb will solve mysteries in our solar system, look beyond to distant worlds around other stars, and probe the mysterious structures and origins of our universe. We will also examine our place in it. Webb is an international program led by NASA with its partners, ESA (European Space Agency) and CSA (Canadian Space Agency). From concept to blueprint, through years of extensive development and testing, a successful launch and deployment, carefully managed cooldown, precise mirror alignment and instrument calibration, and finally the stunning release of its first full-colour images, Webb begins its science mission. The release of Webb’s first images and spectra kicks off the beginning of Webb’s science operations. Astronomers around the world will have their chance to observe anything from objects within our solar system to the early universe using Webb’s four instruments. Webb’s instruments will give astronomers the ability to observe objects that are too faint or too distant to be seen by other observatories. It will also provide higher-resolution imaging and spectroscopy than any other observatory, allowing astronomers to gather more detailed data than ever before.</p>

<h2>Our third breakthrough Invention: <a href="https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/news/what-is-nuclear-fusion" target="_blank">Nuclear Fusion</a></h2>
<img src="02.jpg" class="img-responsive">
<br><br>
<p>Nuclear fusion is the process by which two light atomic nuclei combine to form a single heavier one while releasing massive amounts of energy. Fusion reactions take place in a state of matter called plasma — a hot, charged gas made of positive ions and free-moving electrons with unique properties distinct from solids, liquids or gases. The sun, along with all other stars, is powered by this reaction. To fuse in our sun, nuclei need to collide with each other at extremely high temperatures, around ten million degrees Celsius. The high temperature provides them with enough energy to overcome their mutual electrical repulsion. Once the nuclei come within very close range of each other, the attractive nuclear force between them will outweigh the electrical repulsion and allow them to fuse. For this to happen, the nuclei must be confined to a small space to increase the chances of collision. In the sun, the extreme pressure produced by its immense gravity creates the conditions for fusion. Fusion could generate four times more energy per kilogram of fuel than fission (found in nuclear power plants) and nearly four million times more energy than burning oil or coal. Most of the fusion reactor concepts under development will use a mixture of deuterium and tritium—hydrogen atoms that contain extra neutrons. In theory, with just a few grams of these reactants, it is possible to produce a terajoule of energy. This is roughly the amount of energy one person in a developed country uses for over six years.</p>
